# predict-obesity-levels
Predicting obesity risk levels to support early intervention and cardiovascular disease prevention using machine learning.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
The aim is to classify individuals into different obesity risk categories based on multiple input features such as physical activity, eating habits, age, gender, and other health indicators.

## 📊 Approach
- 📌 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Feature Engineering and Preprocessing
- 🧠 Model Training (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
- 📈 Evaluation with Accuracy, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
- 🧪 Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Optimization

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle Kernels / Google Colab
